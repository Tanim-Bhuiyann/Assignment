          All modern websites and web applications are built using three
          <em> fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These

        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>
          HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper <strong>M</strong>arkup
          <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers
          use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a
          programming language).
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML consists Of elements that describe different types Of content:
          paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers
          understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
        </p>
        <p>In HTML, each element is made up Of 3 parts:</p>
        <ol>
          <strong><li>The opening tag</li></strong>
          <li>The closing tag</li>
          <li>The actual element</li>
        </ol>
